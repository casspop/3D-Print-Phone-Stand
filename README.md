# Phone Stand
 A 3D-printed phone stand to hold a smartphone.

I wanted a simple phone stand for my desk that was trust-worthy and easy to use.  This solution offers several benefits:

- Only two touching points on the bottom allow cables to be plugged in.
- Horizontal arms allow for free movement.  This is a stand, not a phone mount.
- This design allows you to plop the phone in the stand without needing to be precise.
- There are no negotiations that have to be made to remove the phone from the stand.  Just pick it up.
- Parts all print flat, so there are no supports required. [Slicer plating](./Pics/Slicer_plating.jpg)
- Parts are held together with M2.5x6 sheet metal screws. [link to Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L7PDGXO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- A clean, classic design.
